				<p>Founded in 2001 by Ayesha Chaudhury, a graduate of PSFD, the brand has been on a mission to revive
					old Pakistani crafts while creating timeless pieces that transcend trends.
					One of Kapray Vaghera's core principles is to offer customers the ability to curate their own unique
					style by mixing and matching different pieces, from salwars to pants to stoles. The brand places a
					strong emphasis on the quality of the cloth, ensuring that every garment is made to the highest
					standards.
					What truly sets Kapray Vaghera apart is its commitment to empowering women through employment
					opportunities.

				<p>
					By employing women to hand embroider garments from their homes, the brand not only supports their
					livelihoods but also enables them to maintain a balance between work and home life.
					Through carefully crafted patterns perfected over the years, Kapray Vaghera produces one-of-a-kind
					pieces that never go out of style. This approach not only contributes to sustainable fashion but
					also preserves and celebrates Pakistan's rich textile heritage.
					In essence, Kapray Vaghera is more than just a fashion brand; it's a symbol of empowerment,
					craftsmanship, and timelessÂ elegance.
